## 📚 Background

This project began as part of the **Angela Yu Web Development Bootcamp** on Udemy, where the basic interactive drum kit was built. Since then, I’ve **upgraded** the app by integrating:

- 🔄 Cloud storage and retrieval using **Firebase Firestore**
- 🌐 Shareable URLs using **Firebase document references**
- 🎨 An animated beat visualizer with the **Canvas API**

These enhancements apply concepts I learned through the **IBM SkillsBuild Cloud Computing Fundamentals** course.

## 🔧 How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drumkit-app.git
cd drumkit-app
# Just open index.html in your browser
```

To enable cloud features:

1. Set up a Firebase project.
2. Add your Firebase config to the script in `index.html`.
3. Enable Firestore and set proper read/write rules for development.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- 🎛 UI for custom mapping of keys to sounds
- 🎚 Volume & pitch control per track
- 🔁 Looping and layering multiple tracks
- 🌍 User authentication for private/public beat sharing
